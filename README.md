# Predicting Wine Prices
This project aims to predict prices for a selection of wines reviewed by sommeliers. I employ a number of commonly used machine learning techniques.

## Data

## Code
The code is separated into 5 sections.

### 1. Preliminaries
I begin by importing widely used libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing.

### 2. Data
The data was scraped by [Zach Thoutt](https://github.com/zackthoutt/wine-deep-learning) in 2017 from [Wine Enthusiast](https://www.wineenthusiast.com/?s=&search_type=shop).

### 3. Exploratory Analysis

### 4. Natural Language Processing

### 5. Prediction
In this section, I select relevant features, parametrize the machine learning models with k-fold cross-validation, make out-of-sample predictions, and compare performance in comparison to a naive rule-of-thumb model.
